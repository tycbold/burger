# burger

I used the Cats App ctivity as a base for taking a lot of the code, and I got some of the functionality, such as getting the server running without errors and pulling the entries from the database, but I have not figured out how to update them by eating them or adding a new burger. To be honest, I've tried to figure it out a little myself, but there were certain points where I was not sure which document was the one that I should be looking at to fix the problem. Is it a JS issue, or a database issue, or a server issue? I'm having trouble parsing which is which for this activity, which is why it is not totally complete.

I believe I have the burger-js.js file linked correctly in the main.handlebars file, but things are still not quite behaving how they should. 

As far has deploying to Heroku, I've deployed the app but keep getting an Application Error. I thought that it was due to the "main" file distinction in the package.json file, but I've tried a couple of different files to list under that and none of them seem to solve the issue.
